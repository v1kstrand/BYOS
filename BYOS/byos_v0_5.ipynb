      "\n",
      "\"I did on my harness,\" said Simon, \"such as it was; took my mother's\n",
      "blessing, a high spirited woman, who spoke of my father's actions for\n",
      "the honour of the Fair Town. This heartened me, and I felt still bolder\n",
      "when I found myself ranked among the other crafts, all bowmen, for thou\n",
      "knowest the Perth citizens have good skill in archery. We were dispersed\n",
      "on the walls, several knights and squires in armour of proof being\n",
      "mingled amongst us, who kept a bold countenance, confident perhaps in\n",
      "their harness, and informed us, for our encouragement, that they would\n",
      "cut down with their swords and axes any of those who should attempt to\n",
      "quit their post. I was kindly assured of this myself by the old Kempe\n",
      "of Kinfauns, as he was called, this good Sir Patrick's father, then our\n",
      "provost. He was a grandson of the Red Rover, Tom of Longueville, and\n",
      "a likely man to keep his word, which he addressed to me in especial,\n",
      "because a night of much discomfort may have made me look paler than\n",
      "usual; and, besides, I was but a lad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And did his exhortation add to your fear or your resolution?\" said\n",
      "Eachin, who seemed very attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To my resolution,\" answered Simon; \"for I think nothing can make a\n",
      "man so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the\n",
      "knowledge of another close behind him, to push him forward. Well, I\n",
      "mounted the walls in tolerable heart, and was placed with others on the\n",
      "Spey Tower, being accounted a good bowman. But a very cold fit seized me\n",
      "as I saw the English, in great order, with their archers in front,\n",
      "and their men at arms behind, marching forward to the attack in strong\n",
      "columns, three in number. They came on steadily, and some of us would\n",
      "fain have shot at them; but it was strictly forbidden, and we were\n",
      "obliged to remain motionless, sheltering ourselves behind the battlement\n",
      "as we best might. As the Southron formed their long ranks into lines,\n",
      "each man occupying his place as by magic, and preparing to cover\n",
      "themselves by large shields, called pavesses, which they planted before\n",
      "them, I again felt a strange breathlessness, and some desire to go home\n",
      "for a glass of distilled waters. But as I looked aside, I saw the worthy\n",
      "Kempe of Kinfauns bending a large crossbow, and I thought it pity he\n",
      "should waste the bolt on a true hearted Scotsman, when so many English\n",
      "were in presence; so I e'en staid where I was, being in a comfortable\n",
      "angle, formed by two battlements. The English then strode forward, and\n",
      "drew their bowstrings--not to the breast, as your Highland kerne do, but\n",
      "to the ear--and sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could\n",
      "call on St. Andrew. I winked when I saw them haul up their tackle, and I\n",
      "believe I started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet.\n",
      "But looking round me, and seeing none hurt but John Squallit, the town\n",
      "crier, whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft, I took\n",
      "heart of grace, and shot in my turn with good will and good aim. A\n",
      "little man I shot at, who had just peeped out from behind his target,\n",
      "dropt with a shaft through his shoulder. The provost cried, 'Well\n",
      "stitched, Simon Glover!' 'St. John, for his own town, my fellow\n",
      "craftsmen!' shouted I, though I was then but an apprentice. And if you\n",
      "will believe me, in the rest of the skirmish, which was ended by the\n",
      "foes drawing off, I drew bowstring and loosed shaft as calmly as if\n",
      "I had been shooting at butts instead of men's breasts. I gained\n",
      "some credit, and I have ever afterwards thought that, in case of\n",
      "necessity--for with me it had never been matter of choice--I should not\n",
      "have lost it again. And this is all I can tell of warlike experience in\n",
      "battle. Other dangers I have had, which I have endeavoured to avoid like\n",
      "a wise man, or, when they were inevitable, I have faced them like a\n",

      "\"I understand your tale,\" said Eachin; \"but I shall find it difficult\n",

      "especially that I am the son of him whom we have this day laid in the\n",
      "tomb--well that he lies where he will never learn what you are now to\n",
      "hear! Look, my father, the light which I bear grows short and pale, a\n",
      "few minutes will extinguish it; but before it expires, the hideous tale\n",

      "well by fear as by compassion, applied himself to recall him to life,\n",
      "and succeeded in doing so, but not in restoring him to composure. He hid\n",
